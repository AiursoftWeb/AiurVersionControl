# Aiursoft Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to creating a positive and inclusive environment where all participants feel respected and valued.

## Our Principles

To ensure that the software we develop aligns with the Aiursoft Principles and serves all users equally well, we uphold the following:

1. **Offline Functionality**  
   Any compiled artifacts of the software must be capable of performing their full functions without requiring an internet connection.

2. **Local Compilation in Aiursoft**  
   The source code of the software must be capable of being compiled locally within Aiursoft's infrastructure without requiring an internet connection.

3. **Third-Party Local Compilation**  
   The source code of the software must be capable of being compiled locally by third-party developers with an internet connection.

These principles ensure the software’s reliability, accessibility, and functionality across varied environments and user conditions.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [anduin@aiursoft.com]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
